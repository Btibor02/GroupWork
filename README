In this project, we introduce memoization in three different programming languages: PHP, Java, and Python. 

Memoization is an optimization technique aimed at storing and reusing the results of frequently used, repetitive computations to enhance program performance. 
In each of the selected programming languages, we illustrate how to apply this technique and demonstrate how it can contribute to improving code performance. Consequently, the project provides developers with an opportunity to explore and apply the benefits of memoization across various environments and languages.
